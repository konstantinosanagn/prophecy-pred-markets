Polymarket Gamma API Endpoints

Markets:
GET https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets

Events:
GET https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events

Query Parameters:
- slug: Filter by market/event slug (e.g., ?slug=fed-decision-in-december)
- limit: Number of results to return
- offset: Pagination offset

Note: If markets endpoint returns empty array [], try the events endpoint instead.
The slug might be an event slug, not a market slug.

Examples:

1. Using curl:
   # Try markets first
   curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?slug=fed-decision-in-december"
   
   # If empty, try events
   curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=fed-decision-in-december"

2. Using Python requests:
   import requests
   
   # Try markets
   response = requests.get("https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets", params={"slug": "fed-decision-in-december"})
   data = response.json()
   
   # If empty list, try events
   if not data:
       response = requests.get("https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events", params={"slug": "fed-decision-in-december"})
       data = response.json()

3. Using fetch (JavaScript):
   fetch("https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?slug=fed-decision-in-december")
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => {
       if (data.length === 0) {
         // Try events endpoint
         return fetch("https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=fed-decision-in-december")
           .then(response => response.json());
       }
       return data;
     });

4. Get all markets (no filters):
   GET https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets

Additional Endpoints for Order Book, Graph, and Resolution:

1. ORDER BOOK DATA:
   ✅ AVAILABLE via CLOB API
   
   GET https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id={TOKEN_ID}
   
   Use the clobTokenIds from the market data (first token ID is usually "Yes", second is "No").
   
   Example:
   curl "https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id=74018646712472971445258547247048869505144598783748525202442089895996249694683"
   
   Returns:
   {
     "market": "0x...",
     "asset_id": "...",
     "timestamp": "...",
     "bids": [
       {"price": "0.019", "size": "205537.55"},
       {"price": "0.018", "size": "427343.51"},
       ...
     ],
     "asks": [
       {"price": "0.02", "size": "135864.19"},
       {"price": "0.021", "size": "60888.04"},
       ...
     ],
     "min_order_size": "5",
     "tick_size": "0.001"
   }
   
   Note: You need to query BOTH token IDs (Yes and No) to get complete order book for both outcomes.

2. GRAPH/HISTORICAL DATA:
   The Gamma API does NOT provide historical price chart data.
   
   Options:
   - Use Polymarket's GraphQL subgraphs (The Graph) for historical data
   - Query trade history and aggregate prices over time
   - Use third-party APIs like FinFeedAPI Prediction Markets API
   
   GraphQL Subgraph endpoint (example):
   https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/polymarket/fpmm-subgraph
   
   Query for historical trades/prices using conditionId or market ID.

3. RESOLUTION DATA:
   The Gamma API includes basic resolution info:
   - resolutionSource (URL or description)
   - resolvedBy (resolver address)
   - endDate (market end date)
   
   For detailed resolution status:
   - Check Polymarket's resolution subgraph
   - Query the resolution source URL directly
   - Use resolution status endpoints if available

Summary:
✅ Order Book: Available via CLOB API (https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id={TOKEN_ID})
   - Returns full bids and asks arrays with price and size
   - Query both token IDs (Yes and No) for complete order book
   
❌ Graph/Historical: NOT available in Gamma API
   - Use GraphQL subgraphs (The Graph) for historical price data
   - Or aggregate from trade history
   - Or use third-party APIs
   
⚠️ Resolution: Basic info in Gamma API, detailed status needs subgraph
   - Gamma API has: resolutionSource, resolvedBy, endDate
   - For detailed resolution status, query resolution subgraph
